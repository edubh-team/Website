## 5. Update Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual EmailJS credentials:

```env
# EmailJS Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_actual_service_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_CONTACT_TEMPLATE_ID=your_contact_template_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_APPLY_TEMPLATE_ID=your_apply_template_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_public_key
```

## 6. Test the Integration

1. Restart your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to your contact page and application page
3. Fill out and submit the forms
4. Check Abhijit@edubh.com for incoming emails

## 7. Important Notes

- **Free Plan Limits**: EmailJS free plan allows 200 emails per month
- **Email Delivery**: Emails may take a few minutes to arrive
- **Spam Folder**: Check spam/junk folders if emails don't appear in inbox
- **Error Handling**: The forms include proper error handling and loading states
- **Form Validation**: All required fields are validated before submission

## 8. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Emails not being sent:**
   - Check your environment variables are correct
   - Verify your EmailJS service is active
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Emails going to spam:**
   - Add your EmailJS service email to contacts
   - Check your email service reputation

3. **Template variables not working:**
   - Ensure template variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Check template syntax in EmailJS dashboard

### Testing in Development:

You can test the forms locally by:
1. Filling out the forms on your local development server
2. Checking the browser console for any errors
3. Verifying emails are received at Abhijit@edubh.com

## 9. Security Notes

- Environment variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix are exposed to the client
- EmailJS public key is safe to expose as it's designed for client-side use
- Never expose your EmailJS private key or email passwords

## 10. Next Steps

After setting up EmailJS:
1. Test both forms thoroughly
2. Consider setting up email templates with your branding
3. Monitor your EmailJS usage in the dashboard
4. Consider upgrading to a paid plan if you need more than 200 emails/month
